                    The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, &#8220;Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,&#8221; or &#8220;good Gobbo,&#8221;

Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment, I will run.</line>

                    The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a&#8217; my shoulders, no sighs but a&#8217; my breathing, no tears but a&#8217; my shedding.</line>
